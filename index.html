        <h1>About the Book</h1>
        <p>This children's book is dedicated to the memory of my cousin, Yosef Malachi Guedalia, a brave soldier who gave his life protecting civilians on October 7th, 2023.</p>
        <p>The book was inspired by my twin boys, both named after Yosef. I wanted to share with them the remarkable person behind their name and convey important lessons about kindness and courageâ€”values Yosef exemplified every day.</p>
        <p>Throughout the pages, I have incorporated small details from Yosef's life, such as hints of his favorite activities, posters from his room, and even Clif Bars, a favorite snack.</p>
